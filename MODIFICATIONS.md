# Modifications log — mlgidDETECT_DINO (+ sibling mlgidDETECT)

Running record of changes made during the pygid-eval + ring/segment work. Newest phase last.
Two repos are touched: **DINO** = `mlgidDETECT_DINO`, **PKG** = `mlgidDETECT` (deployment package).

---

## A. Labeled pyGID evaluation port (DINO)
Goal: evaluate pyGID/NeXus `.h5` files (with `data/img_gid_q` + `fitted_peaks` GT) in this repo.
- **NEW `util/pygidloader.py`** — `detect_dataset_type`, `_load_fittedpeaks` (visibility 3/2/1 → confidence
  1.0/0.5/0.1, q-space → polar-pixel xyxy boxes), read-only `PyGIDDataset` (daemon worker + queue,
  `load_labels`). Mirrors the PKG loader minus the ONNX write-back.
- **`util/imgcontainer.py`** — added `visibility` field to `Labels`.
- Auto-detect routing: pygid → `PyGIDDataset(load_labels=True)`, else legacy `H5GIWAXSDataset`.

## B. Fixes to make `--eval` actually run (DINO `main.py`)
- Registered `--eval_file` (dest `eval_file_cli`, distinct so it doesn't collide with the config's
  `eval_file` in the cfg→args merge; CLI overrides config).
- Rewrote the resume/output_dir resolution: cross-platform (`os.path.dirname`, was a Windows `\\`
  split that silently forced the config `root_dir`), honors an explicit `--output_dir`, accepts
  `--resume` as a run directory (appends `checkpoint.pth`).
- Replaced the broken COCO `--eval` path (`data_loader_val`/`base_ds` never built here) with a call
  to the GIWAXS labeled eval. Extracted that into module-level **`evaluate_giwaxs_ap`** (auto-detects
  dataset type, runs the live model, computes intensity-stratified recall/precision/AP).
- **`util/nms.py`** — fixed `perform_nms` image-height (`img_container.boxes` is unset → was
  `AttributeError`); now uses `converted_polar_image.shape[-2]`. (Function later superseded in eval.)

## C. Pre/post-processing parity with the deployed PKG
Goal: DINO-side metrics reflect what the exported ONNX model does in mlgidDETECT.
- **NEW `util/postprocessing.py`** (DINO) — `box_cxcywh_to_xyxy`, `onnx_to_xyxy` (top-225),
  `filter_boxes`, ported verbatim from PKG `postprocessing/utils.py`. `evaluate_giwaxs_ap` now feeds
  the live model's raw `pred_logits`/`pred_boxes` (as numpy) through these — replacing
  `PostProcess(150)` + ring/segment `perform_nms`. Verified byte-identical to PKG.
- **`util/exp_preprocess.py`** — `_contrast_correction` now reads `PREPROCESSING_LOG /
  HISTOGRAMEQUALIZATION / (PERE)PROCESSING_PERFORMCLIPPING` from config (was hardcoded), matching PKG.
- **`util/configuration.py`** — added `MODEL_TYPE='dino'`, `PREPROCESSING_POLAR_SHAPE`,
  `PREPROCESSING_LOG`, `PREPROCESSING_HISTOGRAMEQUALIZATION`, `POSTPROCESSING_SCORE/NMSIOU/TTA`
  (mirrors PKG defaults).

## D. Checkpoint-loading fix (DINO)
- **`models/dino/swin_transformer.py`** — uncommented `window_size_h=48, window_size_w=6` for
  `swin_L_384_22k`. The `dinodetr20260304` checkpoints were trained with this elongated window (an
  uncommitted edit); without it `load_state_dict` fails (bias-table 1045 vs 1081). Window recovered
  from the checkpoint's saved `relative_position_index` (288×288 → (48,6)).

## E. Class head + ring/segment as 2 learned classes (DINO)
Goal: drop the 91-class COCO head; learn ring vs segment (segment=0, ring=1).
- **`config/DINO/DINO_4scale_swin.py`** — `num_classes=2`, `dn_labelbook_size=2`.
- **`simulation.py`** — `simulate_img` now returns `is_ring` as a 4th value, aligned with `boxes`.
- **`main.py` `SimulationDataset`** — `target["labels"] = is_ring.long()` (was all class id 1).
- Verified: model builds with a 2-logit head; full forward + DN + focal loss + backward run.
- ⚠️ The old 91-class checkpoint will NOT load under `num_classes=2`. New runs are from scratch.

## F. Class-aware NMS (DINO + PKG, kept in lockstep)
Goal: use the learned ring/segment class to pick the NMS IoU threshold (principled version of the old
y-extent heuristic). Gated by a flag so the legacy 91-class model is unaffected.
- **DINO `util/postprocessing.py`** + **PKG `postprocessing/utils.py`** — `onnx_to_xyxy` records
  `pred_labels`; `filter_boxes` does per-class NMS (ring=1 → `NMSIOU_RING` 0.1, segment=0 →
  `NMSIOU_SEG` 0.4) when `POSTPROCESSING_CLASSAWARE_NMS` is set, else single-class NMS (unchanged).
  Verified byte-identical between the two repos.
- **DINO `util/configuration.py`** + **PKG `configuration/configuration.py`** — added
  `POSTPROCESSING_CLASSAWARE_NMS` (default False), `POSTPROCESSING_NMSIOU_RING=0.1`,
  `POSTPROCESSING_NMSIOU_SEG=0.4`. `evaluate_giwaxs_ap` sets the flag True.

## G. Per-epoch dual eval, every N epochs (DINO)
- **`config/DINO/DINO_4scale_swin.py`** — `eval_files = {'41':…, 'organic':…}` (real paths; the old
  `eval_file='/datasets/41.h5'` placeholder fixed), `eval_interval = 2`.
- **`main.py`** training loop — every `eval_interval` epochs, evaluates each dataset in `eval_files`,
  writes `exp_ap_<name>.txt` (`epoch<TAB>ap_total`) and prints each; each wrapped so one failure
  never aborts training or skips the other.

## H. Improvement #3 — close the synthetic→real domain gap (Path A) — TRIED & REVERTED (no AP gain)
**Status: reverted.** The `simulation.py` masking/digitalize/quazipolar edits below were implemented,
retrained, found to give no AP improvement (see "Retrain outcome"), and reverted via
`git checkout -- simulation.py`. Only the 2-class `is_ring` work (Phase E) remains in the code. This
section is kept as a record of the audit + negative result. Audited the
synthetic training images (`simulation.py`) vs real preprocessed images (`standard_preprocessing`
on organic + 41) by comparing pixel distributions and spatial masks.

**Audit findings** (figures under `train_output/`: `synth_vs_real_corrected.png`, `mask_geometry.png`,
`synth_vs_real_final.png`):
- Contrast/intensity center already well-matched (means ~0.51–0.56) — the parity work (C) holds.
- **Dominant gap = masking**: synthetic masked only ~3.5% of pixels vs real ~30% (organic 0.35 / 41
  0.27). Real polar images have a large zero region in the high-q / high-angle corner (detector
  geometry) that the simulation barely reproduced.
- **Root cause = a WIDTH-regression bug** in `simulate_img.add_dark_area.calculate_angle_limits_mask`:
  it computed the correct corner region from `AngleLimits` but then scattered it via
  `y_shifted = col*(1+(WIDTH-512)/512)` (works at WIDTH=512; at WIDTH=1024 it doubled the column
  index → only a thin sliver was masked).
- Secondary gap: `digitalize_img` quantised to 16–64 levels/image (real ~250).

**Fixes (`simulation.py`):**
- `calculate_angle_limits_mask` rewritten to use the corner region directly at the same `q/(1+...)`
  radius the box labels use (`filter_dark_area`, line ~643), so the image mask lines up with where
  labels are clipped. Masked region set to **0** (was a gray `level`) in both the polar and
  quazipolar branches, matching real.
- `simulate_img`: re-apply the detector mask (`clahe_img * mask`) at the very end so the masked
  region is **exactly 0** in the final image (the contrast steps otherwise lift it off zero, as real
  zeroes invalid pixels AFTER contrast). Added a guard to regenerate any image masked >70% (rare
  degenerate angle-limit/quazipolar combos).
- `digitalize_img`: 16–64 → **128–256** levels.
- `AngleLimits.size_ratio_range`/`r_size` left unchanged (they also drive box clipping; masking
  magnitude is governed by the corner geometry, not these knobs).
- **Tuned the masked fraction to ~0.30**: the masking is bimodal — the **polar** branch masks ~0.24
  (matches the standard-polar eval; 41 is 0.265) while the **quazipolar** branch (a skewed geometry)
  masks ~0.55. The original 50/50 split gave ~0.40 overall. Reduced the quazipolar branch frequency
  from 50% to ~20% (`filter_dark_area`: `random_nr > .5` → `> .8`), which both centers the overall
  masked fraction at ~0.30 and skews training toward the polar geometry the model is evaluated on.

**Result (verified):** synthetic masked fraction 3.5% → **~0.32 mean (0.21–0.63)**, real ~0.30
(organic 0.35 / 41 0.27); per-image levels 16–64 → ~213 (real ~250); box centers landing in masked
pixels 0.5%; 2-class forward+loss+backward still runs.

**Retrain outcome (run `ringseg_2class_pathA_20260605-214922`, matched pre-LR-drop comparison vs the
old-sim run `ringseg_2class_20260603-142434`): NO improvement.** organic AP tied (~0.52 at ep200-258,
old 0.522 / Path A 0.521); 41 AP slightly WORSE (~0.72 vs 0.74). Plot:
`compare_pathA_vs_old.png`. Conclusion: the masking distribution gap was real but **not
performance-limiting** — DETR already ignores zero regions; the heavier masking removes some high-q
peaks from training labels, marginally hurting 41. **Decision: discarded — `simulation.py` reverted.**
The audit + negative result are themselves a useful finding (synthetic-side tweaks won't move AP;
the real lever for the organic set is #3 Path B, fine-tuning on real labeled data).

## I. Semi-supervised pseudo-labeling on the real corpus (Semi-DETR MVP, DINO) — TRAINING-ONLY
Goal: sim→real adaptation via mean-teacher pseudo-labeling of the 13k-frame real unlabeled corpus
(the #1 untried lever per ROADMAP). Full design + rationale: **`docs/SEMI_DETR_INTEGRATION.md`**
(Semi-DETR, Zhang et al. CVPR 2023, arXiv:2307.08095). The exported ONNX graph, pre/post-processing,
and `--eval` path are all unaffected — only training changes; old checkpoints still load.
- **`datasets/real_unlabeled.py`** — NEW. `RealUnlabeledDataset` serves weak/strong view pairs of
  `backbone_ssl_corpus.h5` (CPU/numpy → `num_workers>0` allowed, unlike the cuda `SimulationDataset`).
  Strong aug = `photometric_strong` (gamma/exposure/q-ramp/noise, mirrors `augment_v2` MINUS its
  internal χ-flip — weak/strong must stay pixel-aligned or pseudo-boxes would be wrong); optional
  shared χ-flip is applied to BOTH views before it. No-data stays exactly 0.
- **`engine.py`** — NEW `make_pseudo_targets` (EMA-teacher forward on weak views → per-class score
  thresholds, seg lower than ring for faint recall → class-aware NMS ring 0.1/seg 0.4 → target dicts
  in the exact `SimulationDataset` schema) and NEW `train_one_epoch_semi`
  (`L_sup(synthetic, DN on) + λ(epoch)·L_unsup(real pseudo, DN off)`; λ ramps after
  `semi_start_epoch`; teacher hard-seeded from the student at the semi boundary via `ema_m.set`).
  DN is disabled on pseudo-targets by zeroing `model.dn_number` for that forward (calling
  `model(x)` with no targets in train mode would crash in `prepare_for_cdn`; DN toward noisy
  pseudo-boxes would also just reinforce teacher error). Logs `loss_unsup`/`lam`/`pseudo_seg`/
  `pseudo_ring` per step — if `pseudo_seg` decays to 0 the loop is eating its own tail.
- **`models/dino/matcher.py`** — NEW `TopkMatcher` (one-to-many: each pseudo-box supervises its
  top-M lowest-cost queries), the building block for Semi-DETR stage-wise hybrid matching.
- **`models/dino/dino.py`** — `SetCriterion` gained `matcher_o2m`/`use_o2m` (default off); the four
  matcher call sites (main/aux/interm/enc) use the o2m matcher only while the engine flips
  `use_o2m` around the unsupervised criterion call. `build_dino` attaches the `TopkMatcher`.
- **`main.py`** — builds the real loader once before the epoch loop when `use_semi`; branches to
  `train_one_epoch_semi`; per-epoch eval additionally logs the EMA teacher's AP during the semi
  phase (`exp_ap_<name>_teacher.txt`) — the teacher is the natural deployment candidate.
- **`config/DINO/DINO_4scale_swin_semi.py`** — NEW config with all knobs (`semi_start_epoch=50`,
  `unsup_loss_weight=2.0` + 5-epoch ramp, `pseudo_thr_ring/seg=0.4/0.3`, `use_ema=True`,
  `ema_decay=0.999`; phase-3 `hybrid_matching=False` default).
- **`backbone_curation/ssl/run_detector_semi.sbatch`** (+ `_smoke`) — launchers; `--amp` required
  (two student forwards per step ≈ 2× activations). Auto-resume conventions unchanged.

## Results so far (run `ringseg_2class_20260603-142434`, ep360 of 500; baseline also ~ep350)
| set | new 2-class @ep360 | old 91-class baseline | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| organic (pygid) | **0.554** (still rising) | 0.552 | even / slight edge new |
| 41 (roi_data)   | **0.758** (peak 0.768) | ~0.751 | slight edge new |

## Diagnostics & roadmap
- **Diagnostic C** (where AP is lost) run on the best checkpoint: recall 0.49 / precision 0.81 on
  organic; misses dominated by faint (vis=1 recall 0.28), high-q (recall 0.34 for q>682), and segment
  peaks; ~12 FP/img, half high-confidence. Script `diagnostics/diagnose_C.py`, fig `diagnostics/diagnose_C.png`.
  → it's a representation/sensitivity ceiling, not preprocessing. Full analysis + forward ideas
  (self-supervised backbone on real+sim; physics-informed) in **`ROADMAP.md`**.
- **Physics wins validated & shelved** (`diagnostics/{diagnose_rings,sweep_nms,viz_fp}.py` + PNGs):
  symmetry is out-of-frame (single 0–90° quadrant); ring-aware FP rejection fails (FPs are ON rings,
  ~93% within 8px-q of a real peak); NMS tuning doesn't help (FPs aren't duplicates). **The FPs are
  confident, on-ring, at unlabeled angles → likely real peaks the GT missed (incomplete labels).**
  So precision 0.81 is likely pessimistic and the eval may be label-limited, not model-limited. See
  ROADMAP.md "KEY FINDING". Next: expert review of `viz_fp.png` to confirm.

## Open / not yet done
- Path A (#3 simulation fix) tried and reverted — no AP gain (see Phase H). The 2-class model from
  `ringseg_2class_20260603-142434` (organic ~0.55 / 41 ~0.76 by ep360) stands as the current best.
- Improvement #3 Path B (fine-tune on real labeled data) — the remaining real lever for organic AP,
  but needs labeled real data held out from eval (currently all of 41 + organic is used for eval).
- Improvement #4 (backbone/schedule) — not started.
- Optional: a clean 500-epoch run of the (un-Path-A) 2-class model for the final number.
- `PREPROCESSING_FLIPHORIZONTAL` and TTA not ported (default off).
- Git: phases A–G committed on branch `pygid-eval-ringseg` (pushed). Phase H reverted (not
  committed). Only `MODIFICATIONS.md` is currently modified (this negative-result record) — commit
  when convenient.
